```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## 🧪 Development

### **Available Scripts**

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                 # Start Next.js development server
npm run dev:emulator        # Start with Firebase emulators

# Production
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run start              # Start production server

# Firebase Emulators
npm run emulator           # Start Firebase emulators
npm run emulator:ui        # Start emulators with web UI
npm run emulator:export    # Export emulator data
npm run emulator:import    # Import saved emulator data

# Code Quality
npm run lint               # Run ESLint
npm run type-check         # TypeScript type checking
```

### **Development Workflow**

1. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
   # Start development environment
   npm run dev:emulator
   ```

2. **Code Quality Standards**
   - **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
   - **ESLint**: Enforced code standards
   - **Prettier**: Consistent formatting
   - **Component Patterns**: Follow existing patterns

3. **Testing Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Manual testing with emulators
   npm run emulator:ui
   
   # Test different user roles
   # - Create test workspaces
   # - Test permission inheritance
   # - Verify RBAC functionality
   ```

### **Key Development Patterns**

#### **Service Layer Pattern**
```typescript
// All business logic follows this pattern
export class ServiceName {
  static async methodName(params: ParamType): Promise<ReturnType> {
    // 1. Permission checks
    // 2. Data validation
    // 3. Business logic
    // 4. Firebase operations
    // 5. Error handling
    // 6. Activity logging
  }
}
```

#### **RBAC Integration**
```typescript
// Always check permissions before rendering
const permissions = usePermissions();
if (!permissions.canManageUsers) return null;

// Use service-layer permission checks
const canEdit = await UserService.canEditUser(userId, targetUserId);
```

#### **Responsive Design**
```typescript
// Mobile-first Tailwind classes
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <Card className="p-4 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
    {/* Content */}
  </Card>
</div>
```
