🚧 What Needs to be Built (Business Logic & UI)
❌ Not Yet Implemented (Phase 2 - READY TO BUILD)
❌ Sub-workspace creation UI - Interface to create sub-workspaces
❌ Workspace switching - Owner can switch between main workspaces
❌ Region/Branch selection - UI to bind sub-workspaces to locations
❌ Team workspace binding - Teams specify main + sub workspace
❌ Data scoping enforcement - Reports/folders filtered by workspace access
❌ Cross-workspace authorization - Permission system for accessing other workspaces

🛠️ What You Can Test Right Now
Since your migration is complete, you can verify the enhanced foundation:
1. Enhanced User Management 🔍
Go to Dashboard → Users → User Management
Notice users now have hierarchical permission fields
User roles are now inheritance-ready
2. Workspace-Aware Teams 👥
Go to Dashboard → Teams
Teams are now properly scoped to your main workspace
Ready for cross-workspace team management
3. Enhanced Settings ⚙️
Go to Dashboard → Settings
Your workspace now has hierarchical settings
Sub-workspace controls are foundation-ready


📋 Phase 2 Implementation Plan
Now that your foundation is solid, here's what we can build next:
Week 3-4: Core Services (Next 1-2 weeks)
Sub-Workspace Creation Service
Workspace Switching Interface
User Inheritance System
Enhanced Navigation
Week 5-6: UI Features (Following 1-2 weeks)
Sub-Workspace Creation Dialog
Workspace Selector Component
Hierarchy Management Panel
Settings Integration


📋 Key Features Implemented
🛡️ Backward Compatibility
Existing functionality unchanged - all current features work exactly as before
Optional hierarchical fields - existing workspaces continue to function
Graceful migration - can be run when ready, no forced changes
🔐 Security & Safety
Automatic backups before any migration
Validation at every step to prevent data corruption
Rollback procedures for emergency recovery
Environment checks before making changes
📊 Comprehensive Validation
Data integrity checks for all hierarchical relationships
Consistency validation across the entire system
Performance monitoring for potential issues
Cross-reference validation between entities

1. Role Inheritance Rules
Main Workspace Owner → Can manage all sub-workspaces
Main Workspace Admin → Can view all sub-workspaces, manage if granted
Sub-Workspace Owner → Full control over their sub-workspace only
Inherited Users → Same role in sub-workspace as main (unless overridden)

 Resource Isolation
Teams/Branches belong to specific workspace (main or sub)
Users can be inherited or directly assigned
Projects/Tasks scoped to their workspace
Reports can be workspace-specific or cross-workspace


Main Workspaces (top-level)
Sub-Workspaces (with parentWorkspaceId)
Owner role (full system control)
Admin role (workspace management)
Member role (standard access)
