# Task Completion & Notification Debug Instructions

## Current Issue
Your debug output shows:
- **Completion Rate: 0%** (0 completed tasks out of 1 total task)
- **Critical Alerts: 0** (no urgent/high priority notifications)

## How to Use the Debug Panel

### 1. Access the Debug Panel
1. Navigate to the **Departments** page in your application
2. Look for the **"Debug Panel"** button in the top-right corner of the Department Overview section
3. Click the button to show/hide the debug panel

### 2. Test Task Completion

**To increase your Completion Rate:**
1. Click **"Create Test Task"** to add a new task
2. Once created, you'll see the task listed with a **"Mark as Completed"** button
3. Click **"Mark as Completed"** to change the task status
4. Click **"Refresh Data"** to reload the current state
5. Go back to the Department Overview cards to see the updated completion rate

### 3. Test Critical Alerts

**To see Critical Alerts:**
1. Click **"Create Test Alert"** to add a new urgent notification
2. The system counts notifications with 'urgent' or 'high' priority as critical alerts
3. Click **"Refresh Data"** to reload the current state
4. Go back to the Department Overview cards to see the updated critical alerts count

### 4. Understanding the Data

The debug panel shows:
- **Tasks Section**: Lists all tasks with their current status and priority
- **Notifications Section**: Shows all notifications with their priority levels
- **Instructions Section**: Provides current status and step-by-step guidance

### 5. Real-World Usage

In normal usage (without the debug panel):
- **Tasks** are marked as completed through the regular task management interface
- **Notifications** are created automatically by the system for various events (deadlines, assignments, etc.)
- **Critical Alerts** appear when there are urgent system notifications or high-priority items requiring attention

## Current Status Summary

Based on your debug output:
- You have **1 project** ("Administrative")
- You have **1 task** but it's not completed yet
- You have **0 notifications** currently

Use the debug panel to create test data and see how the completion rate and critical alerts change in real-time!

## Next Steps

1. Use the debug panel to create and complete some test tasks
2. Create some test notifications with different priority levels
3. Observe how the Department Overview cards update with the new data
4. Once you're satisfied with the functionality, you can remove the debug panel by hiding it

The debug panel is a temporary tool to help you understand and test the system - it can be removed once you have real data flowing through your application.
