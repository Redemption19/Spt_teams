# Security Implementation for Role-Based Account Management

## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### ❌ **BEFORE (Security Issues):**
- Users could self-select any role during registration (Admin, Owner, Member)
- No validation of role assignment
- Potential for privilege escalation attacks
- Anyone could become an admin or owner

### ✅ **AFTER (Secure Implementation):**

## 🛡️ Secure Role Assignment Logic

### **1. Registration Types:**

#### **🔑 First User (Organization Setup):**
- First user to register automatically becomes **Owner**
- Checked via `UserService.hasOwner(workspaceId)`
- Cannot be bypassed or overridden

#### **📧 Invitation-Based Registration:**
- Role is **pre-assigned** in the invitation
- User cannot change the role during registration
- Role comes from validated invitation token
- Invitation expires after 7 days

#### **🚪 Open Registration:**
- All new users default to **Member** role
- Cannot self-promote to Admin or Owner
- Must be promoted by existing Admins/Owners

### **2. Role Promotion Rules:**

```typescript
// Only existing Owners/Admins can promote users
UserService.updateUserRole(userId, newRole, updatedBy)

// Prevents removing the last owner
if (newRole !== 'owner' && user.role === 'owner') {
  if (!hasOtherOwners) {
    throw new Error('Cannot remove the last owner');
  }
}
```

### **3. Invitation Security:**

#### **Secure Token Generation:**
```typescript
generateInviteToken(): string {
  return Math.random().toString(36).substring(2) + 
         Date.now().toString(36) + 
         Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
}
```

#### **Invitation Validation:**
- ✅ Token exists in database
- ✅ Status is 'pending' (not already used)
- ✅ Not expired (7-day limit)
- ✅ Role assignment is from invitation, not user input

### **4. Database Security Rules:**

#### **User Creation:**
```typescript
UserService.createUserSecurely({
  id: firebaseUser.uid,
  email: firebaseUser.email,
  name: fullName,
  workspaceId: 'workspace-1',
  inviteToken?: string,
  preAssignedRole?: 'admin' | 'member'
  // Role determined securely by UserService.determineUserRole()
});
```

#### **Role Determination Logic:**
1. **If invited:** Use role from validated invitation
2. **If first user:** Assign Owner role
3. **Otherwise:** Assign Member role (default)

## 🚨 Security Features Implemented

### **1. UI/UX Security:**
- ❌ Removed role selection dropdown from open registration
- ✅ Shows informational message for first user (will become Owner)
- ✅ Shows pre-assigned role for invited users (read-only)
- ✅ Terms and conditions checkbox required

### **2. Backend Security:**
- ✅ Role validation at database level
- ✅ Permission checks for role updates
- ✅ Invitation token validation
- ✅ Expiration handling
- ✅ Audit trail for role changes

### **3. Access Control:**
- ✅ User Management page only visible to Owners/Admins
- ✅ Role-based sidebar navigation
- ✅ Function-level permission checks

## 📋 Registration Flow Examples

### **Scenario 1: First User (Organization Owner)**
```
1. User visits /register
2. No existing owner in workspace
3. UI shows: "You're creating the first account for this organization"
4. UserService.determineUserRole() returns 'owner'
5. User becomes Owner automatically
```

### **Scenario 2: Invited User**
```
1. Admin sends invitation with 'admin' role
2. User clicks invitation link: /invite?token=abc123
3. Token validated, role extracted from invitation
4. Registration form shows: "You're being invited as: Admin"
5. Role field is read-only, comes from invitation
6. UserService.determineUserRole() returns 'admin' from invitation
```

### **Scenario 3: Open Registration**
```
1. User visits /register directly
2. Existing owner found in workspace
3. No role selection available
4. UserService.determineUserRole() returns 'member'
5. User becomes Member, must be promoted by Admin/Owner
```

## 🔧 Implementation Files

### **Core Security Files:**
- `lib/user-service.ts` - Secure user creation and role management
- `components/auth/register-form.tsx` - Secured registration form
- `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Updated auth with secure signup
- `app/invite/page.tsx` - Invitation link handler

### **Database Collections:**
```
users/
  - id (Firebase UID)
  - role (securely assigned)
  - status (active/inactive/suspended)
  - workspaceId
  - createdAt, lastActive

invitations/
  - token (unique, secure)
  - email, role, workspaceId
  - status (pending/accepted/expired)
  - expiresAt, createdAt
```

## ✅ Security Checklist

- ✅ **No self-role assignment** in registration
- ✅ **Secure token generation** for invitations
- ✅ **Role validation** at backend level
- ✅ **Permission checks** for role updates
- ✅ **Owner protection** (cannot remove last owner)
- ✅ **Invitation expiration** (7-day limit)
- ✅ **Audit trail** for security events
- ✅ **Default least privilege** (member role)
- ✅ **Database-level validation** of roles

This implementation ensures that role assignment is completely controlled by the system and existing privileged users, preventing any unauthorized privilege escalation.
