# Guest Login Implementation Guide

## Overview

The guest login feature allows users to explore the Spt_teams application without creating a permanent account. Guest users can experience the full functionality with sample data that gets cleaned up when they log out.

## Features

### ✅ What Guest Users Can Do
- **Explore the Dashboard**: View sample data and statistics
- **Browse Teams**: See sample teams and team management features
- **View Tasks**: Access sample tasks with different statuses and priorities
- **Check Reports**: View sample reports and reporting features
- **Navigate Calendar**: Access calendar functionality with sample events
- **Use Analytics**: View sample analytics and charts
- **Access Folders**: Browse file management features
- **Try All UI Components**: Experience the full user interface

### ❌ What Guest Users Cannot Do
- **Create Permanent Data**: All data is temporary and gets cleaned up
- **Invite Other Users**: No user management capabilities
- **Create Workspaces**: Cannot create new workspaces
- **Upload Files**: File upload is disabled for guests
- **Send Invitations**: Cannot invite other users
- **Access Real Data**: All data is sample/demo data

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Guest users are authenticated using Firebase Anonymous Auth
const signInAsGuest = async () => {
  const result = await signInAnonymously(auth);
  // Guest profile is created automatically
};
```

### 2. Guest Profile Structure
```typescript
const guestProfile: User = {
  id: user.uid,
  email: 'guest@example.com',
  name: 'Guest User',
  role: 'member',
  workspaceId: 'guest-workspace',
  teamIds: [],
  createdAt: new Date(),
  lastActive: new Date(),
  status: 'active',
  requiresPasswordChange: false,
  firstLogin: false,
};
```

### 3. Sample Data Generation
The system creates sample data for guests including:
- **Sample Teams**: Demo teams with different configurations
- **Sample Tasks**: Tasks with various statuses and priorities
- **Sample Reports**: Reports in different states
- **Sample Analytics**: Mock analytics data for charts

### 4. Data Cleanup
Guest data is automatically cleaned up:
- **On Logout**: Immediate cleanup of guest data
- **Delayed Cleanup**: 5-minute delay to allow for re-login
- **Firestore Cleanup**: Removes all guest-related documents

## User Experience

### Login Page
- **Guest Button**: Prominent "Guest" button on login form
- **Clear Messaging**: Explains that data is temporary
- **Easy Access**: One-click guest login

### Dashboard Experience
- **Guest Banner**: Prominent banner explaining guest mode
- **Sample Data**: Realistic sample data for exploration
- **Create Account CTA**: Easy path to create permanent account
- **Continue as Guest**: Option to dismiss banner and continue

### Visual Indicators
- **Guest Badge**: Clear "Guest" role indicator
- **Blue Theme**: Guest-specific styling and colors
- **Warning Messages**: Clear communication about data persistence

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
- **Separate Collection**: Guest data stored in `guest-data` collection
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Guest data cannot access real user data
- **Automatic Cleanup**: No permanent data storage for guests

### Permission Restrictions
- **Read-Only Operations**: Most operations are read-only for guests
- **No File Upload**: Prevents any file storage
- **No User Management**: Cannot modify user accounts
- **No Workspace Creation**: Cannot create permanent workspaces

## Configuration

### Firebase Setup
Ensure Firebase Anonymous Authentication is enabled:
```javascript
// In Firebase Console
// Authentication > Sign-in method > Anonymous > Enable
```

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required - uses existing Firebase configuration.

## Usage Examples

### For Demo Purposes
1. **Product Demos**: Show full application functionality
2. **Feature Exploration**: Let users try before they buy
3. **Training**: Use for onboarding and training sessions
4. **Testing**: Test new features with sample data

### For Development
1. **Quick Testing**: Fast access to test features
2. **UI Development**: Test interface without real data
3. **Feature Development**: Develop features with consistent sample data

## Best Practices

### User Communication
- **Clear Messaging**: Always explain data is temporary
- **Easy Migration**: Provide clear path to create account
- **No Surprises**: Don't hide limitations

### Data Management
- **Consistent Samples**: Use realistic but clearly sample data
- **Regular Cleanup**: Ensure guest data doesn't accumulate
- **Performance**: Keep sample data lightweight

### Security
- **Isolation**: Never mix guest and real user data
- **Permissions**: Strict read-only access for guests
- **Cleanup**: Always clean up guest data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Guest Data Not Loading**: Check Firebase Anonymous Auth is enabled
2. **Cleanup Not Working**: Verify Firestore permissions
3. **Sample Data Missing**: Check GuestService initialization

### Debug Steps
1. Check Firebase Console for Anonymous Auth status
2. Verify Firestore rules allow guest data operations
3. Check browser console for authentication errors
4. Verify guest data collection exists in Firestore

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Custom Sample Data**: Allow customization of sample data
- **Guest Analytics**: Track guest usage patterns
- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor guest-to-user conversion rates
- **Enhanced Cleanup**: More sophisticated data cleanup strategies

### Advanced Features
- **Guest Workspace Templates**: Different sample workspace types
- **Guest User Profiles**: Customizable guest profiles
- **Guest Collaboration**: Allow multiple guests in same session
- **Guest Export**: Allow guests to export their sample data
