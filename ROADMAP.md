- Consistent API patterns for CRUD operations
- Centralized error handling and validation
- Type-safe Firebase operations

### **Component Architecture**
- Feature-based component organization
- Reusable UI components in `/components/ui/`
- Business logic separated from presentation
- Consistent prop interfaces and TypeScript types
